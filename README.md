# BooksCRUD
A basic backend application for studying

I started out my professional aspirations with coding with java and spring, but with time, knowladge and standards grow and the one i had in here was old and very incomplete. So i started this new one in order to practice and demonstrate what i believe to be a good one.
I started it out by following a tutorial, just to refresh the mind, now i will use this baseline to build an intersting system: i want it to interface with open library's api's and retrieve information about books and store on a postgres database. Also, i intend to build it all in a monolythic fashion, since there are another projects i intend to use to practice another lenguage, database structure and architecture.
